## Dog animation
A complex animation consisting of 3 parts:
- The dogs head
	- Looks around -> Falls asleep -> Wakes up -> Pants -> Tilts its head
- The dogs tail and hindlegs
	- Kicks with legs -> Does nothing -> Wags tail
- A dream bubble
	- Appears while the head is in the sleep animation. Pops when the dog wakes up

Each part correspond to one animated texture. Together they are used to animate a model that uses these 3 textures. 
Here is the final result:
